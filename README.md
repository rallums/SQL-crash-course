# SQL-crash-course

By completing this course, I was able to learn the foudations of SQL which allowed me to better incorporate SQL into my daily work. The projects 

I completed were for a complete analysis of AirBnb Sydney's business where we: analyzed listing prices and investigsted unverifable listings.

Through these excercises I wa how to manipulate tables, query multiple tables, and complete complex subqueries and joins. 

(SELECT, FROM, WHERE, HAVING, GROUP BY, LIKE, LIMIT, AVG, SUM)
